DOMLauncher
===========

Cordova Powered Android App Launcher Replacement

This is a Beta.  The current default theme loads from your SD CARD (best if the device has an internal than external 
sd card like the Note 2).

All these files are free to use and modify.  Just credit me somewhere, link back here and you make another launcher for the market, please don't sell it!

Folder with the SD CARD, just copy to your sd card.  

DOMLauncher2.3.x is for older androids.  This app is offically only for 4.0+ to make sure hardware is of higher spec.
