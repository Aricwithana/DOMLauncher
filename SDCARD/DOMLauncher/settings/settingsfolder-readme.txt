This is DOMLauncher's settings folder.

sdcardCheck -  Dummy file that is required.  Allows the app to determine if the sdcard is mounted for legacy devices without access to the internal memory.

fullscreenEnabled - On a fresh install this dummy file will exist.  After that it could disappear or reappear depending on if DOMLauncher is in fullscreen or not.  If the file exists, fullscreen the app is, if not, well it isn't full screen.

settings.xml - Havn't used it yet.  An empty file awaiting for a use by anyone.

themeList.xml - This is where the choice of what theme to load.  Inside, replace the value between the <path> tag to the name of the theme folder you want to load.

quickcontacts/quickweb/quickapps.xml - Three empty files to store information for easy retreival and updating.  An XML format I'll decide upon before full release.
